Architecture View
Using PCAM (Partition, Communication, Agglomeration, Mapping) decomposition patterns, combined with program structure patterns like MVC (Model-View-Controller) for modularity and Layered Architecture for separation of concerns, here's the high-level architecture for the decentralized journal app. This ensures scalability, maintainability, and rapid development under time constraints. The app is a React SPA with TypeScript (TS) for UI, supporting Privy or SIWE for auth, Viem for web3 interactions, and Tableland for DA.
Partition (Decompose into Independent Tasks)
Break the system into core functional units:

Authentication Layer: Handles wallet connection and sign-in (Privy for easy onboarding or SIWE for custom control).
Data Access Layer (DA): Manages decentralized storage and queries for notes and folders using Tableland SQL tables.
Business Logic Layer: Core operations like note/folder CRUD, hierarchy management (e.g., moving notes), and real-time aggregation.
UI Layer: TS-based React components for rendering notes in observable views (like Google Docs) and folders (like Google Drive).
Utility Layer: Web3 utilities (Viem for chain interactions) and state management.

This follows functional decomposition, isolating concerns to avoid tight coupling.
Communication (Data Flows and Interactions)
Define interfaces and flows:

Auth to DA/UI: Wallet address flows from auth (Privy/SIWE) to DA for scoping tables (e.g., notes_{address}) and UI for personalization.
UI to Business Logic: User actions (e.g., create note) trigger controllers that call business logic, which interacts with DA.
DA to UI: Real-time updates via polling or Tableland events; use observables (e.g., React hooks with RxJS) for "observable" views.
Error/Async Handling: All flows use promises/async-await in TS for type-safe handling; pub/sub for real-time (e.g., event emitters for folder changes).
Security Flows: Auth verifies signatures; DA scopes data to wallet signer.

This uses message-passing patterns for loose coupling, with MVC controllers mediating UI-DA interactions.
Agglomeration (Group into Modules)
Group partitions into higher-level modules for cohesion:

Auth Module: Combines Privy and SIWE options (configurable via env or props).
Core Domain Module: Aggregates data entities (Note/Folder TS interfaces) and business logic (e.g., services for CRUD).
Persistence Module: Tableland SDK integration, handling SQL queries and transactions.
Presentation Module: UI components grouped by feature (e.g., NoteEditor, FolderTree).
Infrastructure Module: Viem client, hooks for web3 state.

Program structure: Layered MVC:

Model: Data entities + DA (Tableland).
View: TS React components (e.g., observable lists with useEffect for polling).
Controller: Hooks/services that orchestrate flows (e.g., useMoveNote hook).

This agglomeration reduces complexity by creating reusable, testable modules.
Mapping (Assign to Technologies/Implementation)
Map to tech stack for decentralized, free, TS-first setup:

Frontend: Next.js (TS) for SPA, hosted on Vercel.
Auth: Privy (for quick social/wallet login) or SIWE (via viem/accounts for custom signing).
Web3: Viem (replaces ethers.js) for providers, signers, and transactions.
DA: Tableland (decentralized SQL on Polygon/Filecoin).
State/Real-time: React Query or Zustand for caching; polling for observable views.
Types: TS interfaces for all entities/props to ensure type safety.
Patterns Applied: MVC for structure; Observer pattern for real-time UI updates.
