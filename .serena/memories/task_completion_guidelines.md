# Task Completion Guidelines for MostlyJournal

## After Completing Each Development Step
1. **Test the Implementation**: Run `npm run dev` and test the functionality in browser
2. **Check for Errors**: Run `npm run lint` to check for linting issues
3. **Type Check**: Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to verify TypeScript compilation
4. **Git Commit**: Commit changes with descriptive message: `git add . && git commit -m "Step X complete"`
5. **Verify Integration**: Ensure new features integrate properly with existing code

## Quality Assurance Checklist
- [ ] All TypeScript errors resolved
- [ ] Components render without console errors
- [ ] Authentication flow works (Privy/SIWE toggle)
- [ ] Database operations execute successfully
- [ ] UI responds appropriately to user interactions
- [ ] Real-time updates function correctly
- [ ] Error handling provides meaningful feedback

## Integration Testing Points
- [ ] Login/logout functionality
- [ ] Note creation and editing
- [ ] Folder creation and navigation
- [ ] Note organization (move between folders)
- [ ] Real-time synchronization
- [ ] Blockchain interactions (Tableland)

## Final Deployment Steps
1. **Build Verification**: `npm run build` to ensure production build succeeds
2. **Environment Setup**: Configure production environment variables
3. **Vercel Deployment**: `npx vercel --prod`
4. **End-to-End Testing**: Test all functionality on deployed application
5. **Documentation Update**: Update README with deployment URL and usage instructions

## Performance Monitoring
- Monitor Tableland transaction success rates
- Check real-time update performance (5-second polling)
- Verify wallet connection stability
- Test across different browsers and devices
